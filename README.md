Student Job Portal
The Student Job Portal is a Spring Boot application that serves as a platform for students to search and apply for job opportunities, as well as for employers to post job listings and hire talented students.
Job Listings: Employers can post job listings, including job title, description, requirements, and other relevant details. Students can browse through the available job listings to find opportunities that match their interests and skills.

Job Search: Students can search for job listings using various filters such as job title, location, industry, and keywords. The search functionality helps students find relevant job opportunities quickly.

Application Submissions: Students can apply for job listings by submitting their resumes and cover letters through the portal. Employers can review the applications and communicate with the students through the integrated messaging system.
